# Modbus-RTU-network-analyzer
### You can find all of the useful information on my website, in the article: ["Modbus RTU network analyzer"](https://deeptronix.wordpress.com/2025/08/03/modbus-rtu-network-analyzer/).\
There are some dependencies on library I made (mainly: TON.h, TOF.h, R_TRIG.h, F_TRIG.h, RT_TOGGLE.h, DEBOUNCE.h). In the future I will probably release them. For now, you can probably figure out what they do if I tell you they are derived from PLC basic functionalities.\
If you still have doubts, feel free to [ask me a question](https://deeptronix.wordpress.com/contact/).
